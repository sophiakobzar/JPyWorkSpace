# Java Projects

This repository contains three Java projects. Below are the details of each project:


## Project 1: AAA

This project, written by Sophia Kobzar, is a simple Java Swing application that displays a JFrame with a custom drawing panel. The drawing panel displays the letter 'A' in three different styles: transparent, gradient, and textured.

### How to Run

1. Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `AAA.java` file in your terminal.
3. Compile the Java file using the command `javac AAA.java`.
4. Run the compiled Java program using the command `java AAA`.

## Project 2: FractalTree

This project is a Java Swing application that generates a fractal tree. The tree is drawn on a JFrame. The branches of the tree are drawn recursively with varying angles and depths.

### How to Run

1. Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `FractalTree.java` file in your terminal.
3. Compile the Java file using the command `javac FractalTree.java`.
4. Run the compiled Java program using the command `java FractalTree`.

## Project 3: Input

This project is a utility class for reading numbers and characters from text files. It provides methods for reading integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings. It also provides methods for handling errors and end-of-file conditions.

### How to Use

1. Import the `Input` class into your Java project.
2. Create an instance of the `Input` class, passing the name of the input file to the constructor.
3. Use the methods of the `Input` class to read data from the input file.
