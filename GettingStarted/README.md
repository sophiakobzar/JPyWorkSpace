# Bubble Sort Program

This is a simple console application written in C# that demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm.

## Program Details

The program generates an array of 10 random integers between 1 and 100. It then sorts this array using the Bubble Sort algorithm and prints the sorted array to the console. The program also measures and prints the time taken to sort the array.

## How to Run

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution.
3. Run the program.

## Code Overview

- `Main()`: This is the entry point of the program. It generates the random array, starts the stopwatch, calls the BubbleSort function to sort the array, stops the stopwatch, and prints the sorted array and the elapsed time.

- `BubbleSort(int[] arr)`: This function sorts an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

- `PrintArray(int[] arr)`: This function prints the elements of an array.
